# Assignment 3: Unsupervised Learning
This README can be used to understand how to run analyses for assignment 3 in CS 7641. To be able to properly run these files, you must have Python and scikit learn installed.
## Directory Overview
- **data**
    - The data directory includes the data used to perform the analysis.
- **plots**
    - The plots directory includes png images of every figure generated for the report.
## Entrypoints
- run_on_stroke.py
    - This file is the main entrypoint for running the unsupervised analysis on the stroke dataset.
    - To run this file, simply run
    ```python
    python run_on_stroke.py
    ```
- run_on_ww.py
    - This file is the main entrypoint for running the unsupervised analysis on the white wine dataset.
    - To run this file, simply run
    ```python
    python run_on_ww.py
    ```
- NOTE: Each entrypoint file has flags for running different analyses.

## Helper Files
- Each problem is instantiated from its own class in its own file.
- utils.py contains code for performing certain functions shared between problems or algorithms.
